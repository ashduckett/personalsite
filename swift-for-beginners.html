<h1>Variables and Types</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Swift for Beginners</h2>
<p>
A variable is a fundamental unit of programming which we use to assign a name to a value. Variables allow us to store information so we can use it later when we need it.
</p>
<h2>Intro to Strings</h2>
<p>
A strings are a sequence of characters.
</p>
<h2>String Initialisation</h2>
<p>
Very often we'll initialise strings using string literals.
<code>
let myString = "A string"
var myEmptyString = ""
var yetAnotherString = String()
</code>
</p>
<h2>Properities</h2>
<p>
The characters property holds the collection of characters that make up a string. The property can be used to loop through all of the characters in a string.
</p>
<code>
var name = "Ash"
for character in name.characters {
	print("\(name)")
}
</code>
<p>
I have a question. Is this collection an array?
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that you can get the number of characters in a string using the character property's count property.
</p>
<code>
var name = "Ash"
var charCountInName = name.characters.count
</code>
<p>
You can also reverse a string.
</p>
<code>
var name ="Ash"
var reversedName = name.characters.reversed()
</code>
<p>
It's also possible to get the unicode scalars.
</p>
<code>
var name = "Ash"
var scalars = name.unicodeScalars
</code>
<p>
You can access the emoji keyboard from within playgrounds by pressing control + command + spacebar.
</p>
<p>
Question: What will unicodeScalars actually get you? Numbers?
</p>
<h2>String Interpolation</h2>
<p>
var name = "Ash"
var welcomeMessage = "Welcome, \(name), it's nice to see you."
</p>
<h2>String Manipulation</h2>
<h3>String Concatination</h3>
<p>
<code>
var name = "Ash"
var age = "28"
var msg = "Hello, " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old."
</code>
</p>
<h3>Finding a Substring</h3>
<code>
var word = "concatinate"
word.contains("cat")
</code>
<p>
The method call will return true.
</p>
<h3>Replacing a Substring</h3>
<code>
var wordOne = "Hello, my name is Ash"
var newWord = wordOne.replacingOccurrences(of: "e", with: "3")
</code>
<p>
All occurrences of "e" will now be written with a 3.
</p>
