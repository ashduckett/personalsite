        In this lesson we're going to learn about the delegate design pattern. Many of the most
        common views in UIKit use this design pattern. This includes text views, pickers, tables and collections.

    <p>
        Delegates are used to make important connections between model, view and controller.

    <p>
        A delegate is an object that executes a group of methods on behalf of another object. This gives us the ability
        to reuse views without needing to subclass and modify them. We want view classes to be used as is and we want controller and
        model classes to have the freedom to customise those views.
