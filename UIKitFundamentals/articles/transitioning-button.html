        <h3>Transitioning to Storyboard Button</h3>
        <p>
            Now we want to connect up our button the way we did for the label.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, drag a button onto your view.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, take the opportunity to set the button's text to "Click", and the label's text to "0".
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we want to set the target action on the button. Remember the addAction() method? We need to do the same thing here,
            tying together the target, which is the view controller, the action, which is the incrementCount() method and the event that
            will fire the action on the target.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we do this, we need to mark our method as an IBAction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    import UIKit
                        
    class ViewController: UIViewController {
        var count = 0
        @IBOutlet var label: UILabel!
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
        }

        @IBAction func incrementCount() {
            self.count = self.count + 1
            self.label.text = "\(self.count)"
        }
    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Control Click on the button in the outline view, go down to Touch Up Inside, drag to the view controller icon,
                I think either will do, and then choose the method we want to fire. The video shows the one in the canvas view, but
                try the one in outline view too.
        </p>
        <p>
                The other way of doing this is to use the canvas view. You can control click on label in the canvas view,
                drag from the Touch Up Inside event over to the view controller icon in the canvas (or possible the outline view),
                and select the method from there.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, Click Counter should run.
            </p>
