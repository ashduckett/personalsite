        You can see an example of a TableView at this point. It shows just a list of someone's favourite
        things. Remember, at the very least, the table will need two things from its data source. It will need
        the number of rows, and the cell for each row. 
    </p>

        Looking at the view controller for the app, we can see the favourite things model which is simply an
        array of strings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TableView finds out how many rows it has by asking its datasource. More specifically, by invoking the 
        datasource protocol method numberOfRowsInSection.
