            There is a sample application that has a method which needs to display a custom view controller.
            Here's how you might have gone about implementing it.

    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
@IBAction func rollTheDice() {

    let controller = DiceViewController()

    // These are instance variables on the DiceViewController class
    // They are declared as optionals with Int?

    // We set them here so that they have a value before the controller is displayed
    controller.firstValue = self.randomDiceValue()
    controller.secondValue = self.randomDiceValue()

    // Also worth noting is that using the values above, the images are set for the dice
    // inside viewDidLoad()

    // The values are options because we expect them to be nil until the rollTheDice() method is called.

    self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)        
}
            </pre>

        </code>


    </p>
    <p>
        You'll find you get an error if you run this. This is because firstDie is nil. firstDie is an implicitly
        unwrapped optional so we just use it in viewWillAppear(). firstDie is an @IBOutlet to the first die image.
    </p>
    <p>
        On running the given code, in the example, the outlets to our dice views were created in storyboard. We created our
        instance above without storyboard. This means that our button, our image views and the main view, the root view, won't be set.
        What we need is a fully assembled dice view controller from storyboard.
    </p>
        <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
@IBAction func rollTheDice() {

//    let controller = DiceViewController()

    var controller: DiceViewController
    controller = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("DiceViewController") as! DiceViewController
    
    controller.firstValue = self.randomDiceValue()
    controller.secondValue = self.randomDiceValue()

    self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)        
}
            </pre>

        </code>


    </p>
    <p>
        Notice the identifier used in the instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier() method. If you open storyboard and click on
        the DiceViewController, you can look in the Utilities Pane, and click on the identity inspector. You'll see the ID set in the
        Storyboad ID field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something to note here is that before we present the firstValue and secondValue values using the images on the DiceViewController,
        we set the values from the other view controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is usually necessary for a presenting controller to configure or pass data to a new view controller.
