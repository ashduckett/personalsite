    <h3>Creating Click Counter without Storyboard</h3>
    <p>
        First of all create a single view application and name it Click Counter.
        Open ViewController.swift and you should see something like the following
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre>
            <code>
import UIKit
                                
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any other methods, you can delete them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The viewDidLoad() function runs just once, after the intial view object is set.
        We'll be using this code to set up our UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre>
            <code>
import UIKit
                                
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        var label = UILabel()
        label.frame = CGRect.init(150, 150, 60, 60);
        label.text = "0"
                    
        self.view.addSubview(label)
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you run the above code, you will see that we have a UI with a label on it.
        Next, let's code the button.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre>
            <code>
import UIKit
                                
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        var label = UILabel()
        label.frame = CGRect.init(150, 150, 60, 60);
        label.text = "0"
                    
        self.view.addSubview(label)

        var button = UIButton()
        button.frame = CGRect.init(150, 250, 60, 60)
        button.setTitle("Click", for: .normal)
        button.setTitleColor(UIColor.blue, for: .normal)
        self.addSubview(button)
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you run this, you should find that we now have both controls on the
        screen. The button, however does nothing, and the label isn't getting updated.
        Property wise, on the view controller, we only have the view property.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following code, we do a few things. Firstly, we add our model as a property on the view controller. This is the count
        property. Next we add a label property. This can be thought of an outlet, because it will be used to reach out to the UI. This
        property alone won't be enough, just sitting there, so notice that we set it to be the label we created before, right after we
        create it. Lastly we add an incrementCount() method. This method updates the model, and then updates the view.
     </p>
     <p>
        <pre>
            <code>
import UIKit
                    
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var count = 0
    var label: UILabel!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        var label = UILabel()
        label.frame = CGRect.init(150, 150, 60, 60);
        label.text = "0"
        
        self.view.addSubview(label)
        self.label = label

        var button = UIButton()
        button.frame = CGRect.init(150, 250, 60, 60)
        button.setTitle("Click", for: .normal)
        button.setTitleColor(UIColor.blue, for: .normal)
        self.addSubview(button)
    }

    func incrementCount() {
        self.count = self.count + 1
        self.label.text = "\(self.count)"
    }
}
                    </code>
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're close. But we still need the button to call the incrementCount() method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Think back to the button. The button object is an instantiation of the UIButton class.
                        This object belongs to a category of objects called control objects. This means it turns
                        user actions, such as finger taps, into events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our next step is to create an object inside the button. This object will tell the button to contact
                        its view controller when it's clicked. This object is known as a target action, which is where IBAction
                        is derived from as a word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A target action holds three key pieces of information. a) An object to notify, which is the target. This is
                        our view controller. The method on the target to use, which is the action. Also it holds the event that will trigger
                        the target action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's now add the target action to our button.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>
            import UIKit
                                
            class ViewController: UIViewController {
                var count = 0
                var label: UILabel!
                
                override func viewDidLoad() {
                    super.viewDidLoad()
                    var label = UILabel()
                    label.frame = CGRect.init(150, 150, 60, 60);
                    label.text = "0"
                    
                    self.view.addSubview(label)
                    self.label = label

                    var button = UIButton()
                    button.frame = CGRect.init(150, 250, 60, 60)
                    button.setTitle("Click", for: .normal)
                    button.setTitleColor(UIColor.blue, for: .normal)
                    self.addSubview(button)
                
                    button.addTarget(self, #selector(ViewController.incrementCount), for: UIControlEvents.touchUpInside)
                }

                func incrementCount() {
                    self.count = self.count + 1
                    self.label.text = "\(self.count)"
                }
            }
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this new method call, you can see the three things we talked about. The target, which is self, the
                        method to use, which is incrementCount(), and the control event, which is touchUpInside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice that we are adding the target object to the button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A method like the addTarget() method, is sometimes called a callback method. We've configured the button so
                        it'll call back when an event occurs. The method was designed to call back the controller.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, an action is used to let control objects call back the view controller. This means they can call methods on the view controller.
                        Outlets, like our label, work in the other direction, because the view controller calls methods on them.
                    </p>
