        The tutor explains that it would be nice to have button that you
        could use at the end of the story to be able to run through different
        scenarios from the beginning again.

        Create a new subclass of ViewController named MYOAViewController.swift
        and remember to change the name of the class as well. Now go to the identity
        inspector and change the class the view controller uses to the custom class.
        You can do this for all of your views.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside the custom class, add the following code:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
class MYOAViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.navigationItem.rightBarButton = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Start Over", style .plain, target: self, action: #selector(startOver))
    }

    func startOver() {
        if let navigationController = self.navigationController {
            navigationController.popToRootViewControllerAnimated(true)
        }
    }
}
            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Every view controller has a property called navigationItem. This can be used
        to control the title and buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every view controller also has a navigation controller property. It's an optional
        that references the navigation controller that a given view controller is embedded in.
        Given this, when a view controller recieves the notification to start over, it can communicate
        with the navigation controller.
