    <p>
        We have learned to present a custom view controller in a number of ways. We have used code, we have
        used code and a segue where the segue is created in storyboard and the action is invoked in code, and we'have
        also learned to set up a segue entirely in storyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that when we did it entirely with code and grabbed the storyboard instance of our view controller,
        we get an instance and set the instance variables on it directly. We get a chance to prepare for its display.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we use a segue, the view controller never makes an appearance in our code because storyboard hides the creation
        of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        All view controller inherit a method named prepareForSegue(). It's invoked right before any segue is performed. Its entire
        purpose is to allow the current view controller to configure the new one.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
       if segue.identifier == "rollDice" {
        let controller = segue.destination as! DiceViewController

        controller.firstValue = randomDiceValue()
        controller.secondValue = randomDiceValue()
    }
}
