<h2>Editing Lifecycle Methods</h2>
<h3>textFieldShouldBeginEditing(_:)</h3>
<p>
    Before becoming the first responder, the text field calls its delegate's
    textFieldShouldBeginEditing(_:) method. Use it to allow or prevent the editing
    of the text field's contents.
</p>

<h3>textFieldDidBeginEditing(_:)</h3>
<p>
    Called as soon as the user taps inside the text field to edit.
</p>
<h3>textFieldShouldEndEditing(_:)</h3>
<p>
    Before resigning as first responder, this method is called. Use this method
    to validate the current input.

</p>
<h3>textFieldDidEndEditing(_:)</h3>
<p>
    This method is called after the text field resigns as first responder.

</p>

<h2>The Primary Method for Controlling Text</h2>
<h3>textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)</h3>
<p>
    This method is called whenever the current text changes. You can do what you need to,
    then return true if you want to allow the text field to change its text.
</p>


<h2>The Clear Button (The x on the right side of some text fields</h2>
<h3>textFieldShouldClear(_:)</h3>
<p>
    This method is called when the user taps the built-in button to clear
    the text.
</p>

<h2>The Return Key in the Keyboard</h2>
<h3>textFieldShouldReturn(_:)</h3>
<p>
    This method is called then the user taps the keyboard's return button. You can implement this
    to dismiss the keyboard on pressing return. This can be done with textField.resignFirstResponder(),
    and then returning true.
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, when creating a class to act as a delegate, the instructor subclasses NSObject. Why?
