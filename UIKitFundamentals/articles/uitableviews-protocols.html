        UITableViews have two delegate protocols with a total of 44 methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two protocols are UITableViewDelegate which governs responses to user
        events and UITableViewDataSource which enables the UITableView to access data
        and cells.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UITableView uses its delegate protocol to ask event questions like these:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What should happen when a button in a cell is tapped?</li>
        <li>What should be the response to cell selection?</li>
        <li>How should I respond when a user begins editing a row?</li>
        <li>What should happen when a cell is deselected?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The table uses its data source to ask data questions
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How many rows do I have?</li>
        <li>How many sections do I have?</li>
        <li>What are the titles for the sections?</li>
        <li>What is the cell view for each row?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>TableView Delegate Method Signatures</h3>
    <p>
        When we were looking at the protocol methods for the TextView delegate, the first
        argument was the TextField itself. It'll be the same for the TableView's pair of 
        protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
                func tableView(tableView: UITableView, canEditRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> Bool
            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice above that there is an argument above named IndexPath. This is a struct with two members; row and section.
        When the table wants to get the cell for a particular row, it will invoke a method asking for the cell and it will pass
        in an IndexPath property with the row property set.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, when a table wants to alert its delegate that a row was selected, it will invoke the appropriate method, and
        passes in an IndexPath object with the row property set.
    </p>
