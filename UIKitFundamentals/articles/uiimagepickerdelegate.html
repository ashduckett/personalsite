        When the image picker is presented, one of two things can happen. The user might select an image.
        The user might cancel.
    </p>
    <p>
        The protocol is a straight forward refection of these two possibilities. Both methods are optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be a delegate of the UIImagePickerController, your view controller also needs to conform to the
        UINavigationControllerDelegate protocol. All of the methods in this protocol are also optional so you
        could just add it to your view controller's class declaration.
