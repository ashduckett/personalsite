        If you look at the iOS health app, and look at the table
        view for health data you can see a one column table. Each cess contains
        a UIImageView on the left, a label in the middle, and another UIImageView
        on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the maps app there's another one column table. You can search for places
        and this will display a table, and rapidly alter what it contains. You can see that
        each cell is repeating in terms of the icon and placement of text.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contacts, you can see another table view separated into sections. Another example
        is the stack of images you get when you want to pick an image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The small repeating views are called cells, or UITableViewCells. Tables draw in the cells
        vertically and draw in separators.
