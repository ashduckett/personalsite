    <h3>Click Counter</h3>
    <p>
        Click counter is a simple application that shows a label and a button. Initially
        the label will show a 0. When you click on the button, the value in the label will
        increment.

        All of the objects we're interested in are shown as rectangles. Object properties will
        be represented with circles. Looking at the diagram above, you can see a view property 
        on the view controller. All view controllers inherit a view property which points to the root
        view of a page. In this case, the view that paints the white background.

        For our click counter app, we'll need two more objects; the button and the label. We'll
        also need somewhere to store the current value of the int value displayed in the label. We
        can call this count and put it on the view controller.

        We have a model that stores the click count, we have view objects that paint the screen and
        a view controller that ties everything together. These objects will be created and connected 
        right before the page is displayed.

        Imagine that the user hits the button. The button tap will be turned into an event. This will invoke an
        action in the view controller. Next the view controller will update the model. At this point the view controller
        will also need to update the text of the label. At the moment it has no way to do this. In order for this to happen
        we need to add a label property to the view controller so it has access to it.

        This will form the plan.
