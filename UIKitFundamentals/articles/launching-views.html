        If we had the code for the message app, the code that presents the image picker view
        on top of the composer view would be in the view controller that's currently on screen.
        This would be the ComposeMessageVC. The invocation would look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
                self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        The last one, completion, is a closure statement that can be executed once the view is presented.
        The second one specifies whether or not you want the view to be displayed with an animation, if this is
        false, it will appear straight on the screen. The first argument is a reference to the view controller
        that's being presented.

    <h3>Launching the Image Picker View</h3>
    <p>
        You're probably familiar with views like the camera roll, the activity view and the alert view.
        Here's an example of displaying the camera roll:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
@IBAction func experiment() {
    let controller = UIImagePickerController()
    self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you will also need to add a key pair value to the project's Info.plist
        file with the key "Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description" and any value you want.
    </p>
    <h3>Launching the Activity View</h3>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
                @IBAction func experiment() {
                    let image = UIImage();
                    let controller = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [image], applicationActivities: nil)
                    self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
                }

            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
    <h3>Launching the Alert View</h3>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
// This will display the alert view, but gives the user no way of closing it!                
@IBAction func experiment() {
    let controller = UIAlertController()
    controller.title = "Test alert"
    controller.message = "This is a test"

    self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
        <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
// This will display an alert view with an okay button the user can use to dismiss it with.                
@IBAction func experiment() {
    let controller = UIAlertController()
    controller.title = "Test alert"
    controller.message = "This is a test"

    let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "ok", style: UIAlertActionStyle.Default)

    controller.addAction(okAction)
    self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil) { 
        action in self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)

    }
}
            </pre>
        </code>
    </p>
