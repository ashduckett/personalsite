        In storyboard, Apple refers to the transition between view controllers as a segue. These are shown in storyboard
        with a line between two storyboards with a circle in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have learned to use just code to display a storyboard view controller. Now we're going to combine code with a storyboard
        segue.
    </p>
    <p>
        In storyboard, open the popup menu you get from either view controller icon. Under triggered segues drag manual to view controller you
        want to display. At this point you'll get a few options for the segue, choose modal here.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should now set the storyboard identifier for the segue. Select it in the canvas, go to attributes inspector and give it an identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
                @IBAction func rollDice() {
                    performSegueWithIdentifier(identifier: "rollDice", self)
                }
            </pre>
        </code>

    </p>
    <p>
        If you ran this with the dice example, you'd see the view, but no dice. This is because we never set
        the values on the DiceViewController. In fact we never even had a reference to the DiceViewController.
        I wonder, then why it didn't error as before? Perhaps because we're using a connected up DiceViewController, but
        one without values set.
    </p>
    <p>
        This needs to be resolved, however, first lets see how you can setup a segue with no code.
