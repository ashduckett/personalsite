        One way to think about a delegate is to imagine that each key difference between views of the same class
        corresponds to a question that the view could ask of its delegate.
    </p>
    <p>
        What should I do with these new characters? How should I respond when the return button is clicked? What should
        happen when editing begins?
    </p>
    <p>
        The view needs some other class to decide what to do with user input.
    </p>
    <p>
        What kind of object can answer these questions? The view's delegate is usually, but not strictly,
        going to be a control object. It makes sense for control objects to answer the view's questions
        because control objects are designed to perform tasks like passing user input to a model.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to the delegate pattern is that the view establishes the questions that it needs answered
        and encodes them in a protocol. A protocol is a list of methods that a delegate must implement. Any
        object that fulfills the protocol, can become a delegate.
