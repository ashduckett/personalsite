    <h3>Make Your Own Adventure</h3>
    <p>
        In this section, the tutor takes you through building the make your own
        adventure application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a single view application. When you're in, delete the view controller
        that was automatically generated. Notice that this will remove everything from
        the panel and you'll have no scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next drag in a navigation controller. Notice that you get an automatically generated
        root view, and it has a table view in it. You don't need the table view, so delete the root
        view.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next you can drag in a regular View Controller. We'll set that to be the root view controller of
        the Navigation Controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set the root view, Ctrl Click on the Navigation Controller, and drag from root view controller
        under Triggered Segues (I don't know why it's under that), and then drag to the new view controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next thing to do is to drag in a text view control onto the new view controller. Also drag 
        two buttons in for the choices.
    </p>
    <p>
        This view is the first in a series that have the same UI components. Copy and paste the whole view
        controller twice.
    </p>
    <p>
        To segue from one view controller to the next, Ctrl Click on a button, drag from action under Triggered
        segue to the view controller you want to appear. Do this for both buttons. Make sure you select the show
        option.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you run it at this point you'll get a black screen because you haven't set the initial view. Set the navigation
        controller to be the initial view controller.
    </p>
