        <h3>Transitioning to Storyboard Label</h3>
        <p>
            Now we've seen how to build a simple app like this entirely in code, let's take a look at how storyboard represents objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Storyboard has three different ways of showing our objects. There's the expandable outline view, in the visual canvas view,
            and of course the text editor itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can change your code to look like the following:
        </p>
                <p>
            <pre>
                <code>
import UIKit
                    
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var count = 0
    var label: UILabel!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    func incrementCount() {
        self.count = self.count + 1
        self.label.text = "\(self.count)"
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            This way, all we have are our properties, currently one unconnected label and our model. We also hold on to the incrementCount() method.
        </p>
        <p>
            As it is, storyboard doesn't know anything about the label we have declared. We can change that:
        </p>
                <p>
            <pre>
                <code>
import UIKit
                    
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var count = 0
    @IBOutlet var label: UILabel!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    func incrementCount() {
        self.count = self.count + 1
        self.label.text = "\(self.count)"
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    <p>
        Notice that when you do this, Xcode shows a circle in the margin on the left of your outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Closing the code and looking at the outline and canvas views, notice that view controllers are represented using yellow circular icons.
        The outline view is a hierarcal view of the view controller, the view and any sub views. The canvas view is another representation of the
        exact same objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you control click on either of the two view controller yellow icons, we can see our popup connections menu.
        Since we've marked our label as an outlet, we can see it here under the outlets section. The empty circle next to our
        label property is empty, and this is because it hasn't been initialised yet. So let's do that now.
    </p>
    <p>
        To initialise our label, first we drag a label in from the objects menu. Next you can control click from the label in the outline view,
        dragging from new referencing outlet into the label in the canvas view and selecting the label property.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you now check the popup connections menu from either of the yellow icons in the canvas view or the outline view, you should be expandable
        to see that our label property is now set. You can get the same information by control clicking the label in the canvas view. You can unset it
        using the small x.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way to set an outlet property is to drag from the circle shown in the margin of the code editor to your label.
